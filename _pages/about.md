I am a Ramanujan Faculty Fellow in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://iitpkd.ac.in/mechanical-engineering),[Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad](https://iitpkd.ac.in/). My research lies at the intersection of computational science and engineering, encompassing a broad range of topics such as high-accuracy numerical scheme development, high-performance scientific computing, and scientific machine learning. 

Below are some key areas of my current research:

## Scientific Machine Learning and Deep Learning-Based Inversion

The main focus of my current research is on developing and applying deep learning and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in science and engineering. Additionally, I aim to accelerate these processes by eliminating computational bottlenecks. At present, my work centers on the following key sub-areas:

- **Physics-Based Techniques for Inverse Problems**.

In this area, I develop and apply methods that integrate fundamental physical laws and mathematical models to solve inverse problems. This approach enables the derivation of technically optimal solutions while ensuring that the results remain physically consistent. By harnessing well-established principles from physics, my work addresses various aspects of inverse analysis, bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical applications.

- **Deep-Learning-Based Bayesian Inversion**.

I am developing deep learning-based techniques for Bayesian inversion, focusing on the estimation of unknown parameters and the quantification of associated uncertainties. By combining deep learning with Bayesian inference, these methods provide robust parameter estimates along with comprehensive uncertainty quantification. This is particularly important for ensuring the reliability and interpretability of solutions in complex, real-world systems.

- **Data-Driven Constitutive Modeling in Continuum Mechanics**

More recently, I have begun working on data-driven constitutive modeling aimed at discovering constitutive relations for various hyperelastic and viscoelastic materials. This research integrates machine learning with the mathematical and physical principles of continuum mechanics to develop generalized constitutive models of material behavior, offering a robust alternative to traditional phenomenological models.

## Higher-Order Numerical Scheme Development for Computational Electrodynamics (CED)

I have spent a significant portion of my research journey devising numerical schemes, developing code, and creating parallelized frameworks for various important partial differential equations that arise in science and engineering. As a computational engineer, my first experience with computational methods involved fluid flow equations. Later, I applied that experience to my PhD research on numerical modelling and simulation of flow MRI.

Subsequently, I focused on developing higher-order schemes for electrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics. More recently, I have been working on higher-order schemes for time-domain electrodynamics that utilize finite volume time-domain (FVTD) and discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) methods. These techniques are designed to exhibit highly desirable properties—such as low dissipation, low dispersion, and energy preservation—thereby ensuring accurate and efficient simulations of electromagnetic wave propagation.

I am also deeply interested in the broader challenges of wave propagation and magnetohydrodynamics, topics that continue to inspire further exploration in this direction.

## PhD Work: Numerical Modelling, Simulation and Experimental Validation of Dynamic MRI

During my PhD, I collaborated with an interdisciplinary team of scientists specializing in various aspects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). My thesis focused on the numerical modeling, simulation, and experimental validation of dynamic MRI, with a particular emphasis on flow MRI.

Although I am no longer actively engaged in this field, I retain some interest in algebraic image reconstruction and related inverse problems. These topics inspire innovative ideas for potential collaborations, and I look forward to revisiting them with potential collaborators in the future.
